## Overview

Modern Linux systems generate enormous volumes of runtime telemetry. While kernel events reveal **what happened**, deriving meaningful insights requires normalization, correlation, and contextual understanding.

**eTraceGen** is a modular Linux Activity Intelligence Platform that captures kernel activity using **eBPF** and incrementally transforms low-level observations into reusable system knowledge.

Instead of treating telemetry as isolated events, eTraceGen is designed around a layered architecture where each stage adds progressively richer meaning to the data.

## Architecture
eTraceGen follows a layered architecture that separates **observation**, **knowledge construction**, and **intelligence**. Each layer has a well-defined responsibility, allowing the system to evolve without tightly coupling kernel instrumentation to higher-level analysis.

Only the observation layer interacts directly with the Linux kernel. All subsequent processing occurs in userspace, enabling richer analysis while keeping the eBPF programs lightweight and verifier-friendly.

| Layer | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **eBPF Programs** | Capture runtime kernel activity with minimal overhead. |
| **Userspace Collector** | Receive events from the kernel, validate them, and perform initial processing. |
| **Canonical Event Model** | Normalize kernel-specific events into a stable, reusable representation. |
| **Entity Registry** | Maintain state for system entities such as processes, files, sockets, and future object types. |
| **Correlation Engine** | Connect events across entities and time to reconstruct meaningful relationships. |
| **Semantic Engine** | Infer higher-level behaviors from correlated activity. |
| **Policy Engine** | Consume semantic knowledge for detection, analytics, and future policy enforcement. |

# Why eTraceGen?

The Linux ecosystem provides many excellent observability and security tools capable of capturing kernel events with **eBPF**. These tools are highly effective at collecting and exposing telemetry for debugging, monitoring, troubleshooting, and threat detection.

eTraceGen focuses on a different challenge:

> **How can raw kernel observations be transformed into reusable system knowledge?**

Rather than treating events as isolated records, eTraceGen is designed around a layered processing model where each stage adds structure, context, and meaning while remaining independent of the previous layer.

This separation enables:

- **Stable canonical events** independent of kernel-specific details
- **Reusable entity state** shared across higher-level components
- **Incremental enrichment** from observations to semantics
- **Extensible intelligence** without increasing kernel complexity

By separating **observation** from **interpretation**, eTraceGen aims to provide a reusable foundation that can support observability, security analytics, behavioural analysis, and future intelligence-driven workflows without tightly coupling those capabilities to the kernel instrumentation layer.

# Current Capabilities

eTraceGen currently focuses on building a reliable **observation layer** for Linux systems. The project captures runtime activity using eBPF and exports normalized event data through a modular userspace collector.

## Event Coverage

| Domain | Coverage |
|---------|----------|
| 🟢 Process | Process lifecycle (`fork`, `clone`, `exec`, `exit`) |
| 🟢 File System | File operations (`open`, `rename`, `unlink`) |
| 🟢 Syscalls | Raw syscall entry and exit tracing |
| 🟢 Network | Socket lifecycle + socket I/O (`socket`, `connect`, `accept`, `bind`, `listen`, `send*`/`recv*`, `read`/`write`, `close`, …) — compiled in and enabled by default |

## Runtime Features

- Modular eBPF instrumentation
- Userspace event collection using **libbpf**
- YAML-based runtime configuration
- NDJSON event logging
- Size-based log truncation (⚠️ delete-and-recreate at the size limit — **no backups; history at the boundary is discarded**)
- Self-observation suppression
- Verifier-friendly modular BPF programs

## Network Scope

> **Status:** the socket-layer instrumentation is **compiled into the BPF object and enabled by
> default**. It captures the full socket-first taxonomy (control plane + data plane) as metadata-only
> records — no protocol/payload inspection. This is a high-volume profile; see the noise/overhead
> notes in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

Protocol-aware parsing (HTTP, HTTPS, TLS, DNS) and higher-level network intelligence are planned for future development.

# Roadmap

eTraceGen is being developed incrementally, with each phase building on the previous one. The focus is to establish a solid observation foundation before introducing higher-level intelligence.
